## A little bit about myself
I am a Network Solution Architect with over 20 years of experience in large Enterprise and Service Provider networks. I have a strong knowledge and solid hands-on experience with a wide range of networking protocolos. 
I have experience in Design, Migration, Implementation and Network Operations.
I have worked for international leading companies in Mexico and Latin America.   
I am pasionate about learning, and continuously self-improve and learn new technologies to maintain technical leadership on my daily job activities.
I have also for years been interested in software development and automation, and it has become more than a casual hobby.
